To get O-O* RDF by running a 50 ns non-reactive trajectory on a 1000w system, which restrains the two OH distance to about 7 angstrom. Trajectory was dumped every 2000 steps (1 ps). Therefore, I should have 50,000 frames to generate RDF.

1. sbatch run_rdf.sh
2. python get_RDF.py to get RDF_data.txt
